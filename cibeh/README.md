## Project

The purpose of this map is to create a pollution index report for all states within the United States. More precisely, map the average daily emission of pollutant carbon monoxide (CO) against the population density of states in the US to visualize any relationship between population density and carbon monoxide emission.

### Data

Project repository: https://github.com/cibeh/class/tree/master/FinalProject

### Instructional demo

This demo, based on the [class 5 demo](https://umbcvis.github.io/classes/class-05), shows how to plot the GeoJSON data from the project repo.

#### Documentation

Add the following content to the README.md in your repo.

1. 1 or 2 sentences describing overall project goals, e.g., interactive tool?, hypothesis test? (0% complete)

# Project Goals and Objectives

Map and create population density vs carbon monoxide emission chart across the US

Incorporate as many aspects of in-class lessons into map presentation

Produce an aesthetically pleasing and well organized presentation to improve visualization of data

2. Attribution and links to all data sources (0% complete)

# Data Sources

Carbon Emission Data: https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/download-daily-data

*Data has been summarized and filtered to match the specification of this presentation.*

Population Density Data: https://www.census.gov/data.html

*Census data was appended to states shapefile and exported in geoJSON format*

    * describe parameters used in API query to get data (as appropriate)
3. Extremely brief description of all pre-processing, if any (0% complete)

#### Technical

For each step, create a separate gist/block -- link to these in your repo's README.md
